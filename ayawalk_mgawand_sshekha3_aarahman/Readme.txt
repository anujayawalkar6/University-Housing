The implementation is done on WAMP stack. We got approval for this implementation from Professor Ogan.
To run the project, following pre-requisites are needed:

1. A running version of MySQL in the background. The database entries/inserts/stored procedures/event schedulers are all implemented there. The name of the database is set to 'dummy3'
2. PHP needs to be installed since the UI is made using PHP.
3. Start from the index.php page.
4. Login information for all uses the ID(student ID, approval ID, staffID(1-5)) as the username and 123 as the password.
5. Execute normal flow.
6. For extra credit, a likeness matching procedure is implemented where likeness is evaluated for a user and he may desire if he would like a room with that person.
